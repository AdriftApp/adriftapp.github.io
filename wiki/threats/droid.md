## Behaviour 

The Droid moves only after hour 1, meaning you only have to worry once hour 1 is over.

It will loiter around Cam 3, 4 and 5, before proceeding to go down the corridor in Cam 2 to 1, it may decide to turn around, restarting the whole process.

You must shock it using the shock remote when it arrives behind you, failiure to do so will result in your ████ being ████ all over the █████.
