## Details
<br>

At the bottom left of your screen, is the Guild Tech signature, the Console.

Installed in every Guild ship, this state of the art, retro machine.\
Instead of clear, 4k HD security camera system, we have a murky, dark and fuzzy monitoring device.\
The cam system is connected to the vent mouse tracker.

It's also in charge of your ship's navigation, system error fix management and motion sensors.
