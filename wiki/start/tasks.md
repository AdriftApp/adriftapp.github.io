# Tasks

Tasks are what you need to complete an hour, usually ```3 + hour value``` will be enough to get you past the current hour.

---

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Note that you must see a "Task Completed, Please wait for next task" to appear to be considered 1 task done, not at 100%

---

You can do tasks via the task manager at the top right of your screen.
