# Oxygen 
<br>

In the vast emptiness of the darkness outside your ship, the most scarce resource is exactly what you need to stay alive. Oxygen.

Your ship is equipped with an auto regenerating oxygen supply, backed by the latest Guild Tech. However it is controlled by a valve. System errors in the ventilation can cause the valve to close (who even designed this 100% safe ship?).

The invisible meter is set to ```100``` at the start of the game, ventilation errors will cause this meter to drop. Which also causes the screen to darken, fix the error via your console no. 4

If no error is active, the oxygen will regenerate.
